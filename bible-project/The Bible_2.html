        <h2>The miracle it represents</h2>

        <p><strong>The Bible is the most extraordinary book the world has ever seen.</strong> 
            One reason for this is that there are innumerable links between the individual 
            parts of the book. All the authors of the books of the Bible (and there are many), 
            there are no contradictions.

        <h2>The predictions of the future</h2>
        <p>Many prophets have spoken about future events in the pages o the Bible. 
            The probability of their fulfillment is extremely bleak, and yet, it happened.</p>
            <img src="http://www.zeno.org/Kunstwerke.images/I/bsgd0265.jpg?w=500&h=631&vid=1768084738" width="240" height="280" align="right">
            <p>One of the greatest examples would be the prophet <em>Daniel</em>. Sometime 
            before 500 BC, the prophet Daniel prophesied that Israel&apos;s long-awaited Messiah would 
            begin his public ministry 69 “weeks” (defined in <a href="https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Daniel+4%3A23%E2%80%9334">Daniel 4:23&minus;34</a> 
            as 7-year periods, thus 483 years) after a decree was issued to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, 
            according to <a href="https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Daniel+9%3A25%E2%80%9326">Daniel 9:25&minus;26</a>.
            Daniel further predicted that the Messiah would be “cut off” (meaning killed) prior to a later
            destruction of Jerusalem.</p>
            
        <p>These time predictions match closely with the timing of Jesus&apos;s life and death. 
            The decree to restore Jerusalem was issued by Persia&apos;s King Artaxerxes (and recorded 
            by the Hebrew priest <a href="https://nasb.literalword.com/?q=Ezra+7%3A1-10">Ezra</a>) in 458 BC. 
            Roughly 483 years later, the ministry of Jesus began in Galilee. Jesus&apos;s crucifixion occurred 
            just a few years later, followed in AD 70 by Titus&apos;s devastation of Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>While historians have established an accurate date for the destruction of Jerusalem, 
            the dates for the start of Jesus&apos;s Messianic ministry, as well as for his birth and 
            crucifixion, are known a little less accurately, but to within a few years. Most 
            historians assign a date of &sim;26 AD to the beginning of Jesus&apos;s ministry. Note also 
            that the Persian king issued two more decrees within a few years of 458 BC concerning 
            the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem and the construction of Jerusalem and its walls. 
            Thus, there has been some debate as to the exact date.
            <br><strong>Probability of chance fulfillment = 1 in 10<sup>6</sup>.</strong></p><br>
